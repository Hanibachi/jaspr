You can use `jaspr_content` in either **static** or **server** mode. 

- In **static** mode, your site is built as a static site. This means that all content is pre-rendered and served as static files. This is the recommended approach for most use cases, as it allows for faster load times and better SEO.

- In **server** mode, your site is rendered on the server for each request. This allows for dynamic content and is useful for sites that require real-time data or user-specific content.

Building and deploying your site is the same as with normal Jaspr apps. Simply use the `jaspr build` command to build your site.
