## jaspr_content

A package for building **content-driven sites** like documentation, blogs or marketing pages with Jaspr.

It provides **out-of-the-box tools** for loading, parsing, and rendering content from various sources like markdown files. It is **fully customizable** and you are able to add your **own implementations** for each part.

## Features

- **📖 Markdown**: Load and parse markdown files from your filesystem or a remote source (e.g. Github).

- **🗃️ Frontmatter**: Parse frontmatter data from markdown files and use it in your components.

- **🖋️ Templating**: Use a templating language like [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) to inject data into your content.

- **🧩 Components**: Enhance your content with  Jaspr components like [`<Info>`](/content/components/callout) or [`<Tabs>`](/content/components/tabs). Choose from the built-in components or add your own.

- **📐 Layouts**: Use pre-defined layouts like the [DocsLayout](/content/layouts/docs_layout) or create your own.

- **🎨 Theming**: Use the built-in [theming system](/content/concepts/theming) to customize the look and feel of your site. With light and dark mode out of the box.

> `jaspr_content` is fully compatible with "normal" Jaspr. You can use components and pages you already have in your app and mix them with content from `jaspr_content`.
